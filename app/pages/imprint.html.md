About me
--------
I am Tom Russell, a professional software developer, and less professional
amateur photographer.

About this site
---------------
This is my personal photography portfolio. For my writings on software
development, see my [ruby/rails blog](http://www.trdev.co.uk).

This site is written in Ruby on Rails, the source code to which is freely
available [on github](https://github.com/kalleth/pholio-rails).
